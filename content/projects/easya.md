### Introduction:
This was a project for CS 422 Software Methodologies at the University of Oregon and was developed by a team of five people. This program generates graphs 
of grade data for professors and courses taught at the University of Oregon based on a data set obtained from The Emerald's grade tracker.
The program was written in Python3 and the UI was created with tkinter and graph generation was done with matplotlib.

#### Github Link:
Link will be added once the project has been graded.
