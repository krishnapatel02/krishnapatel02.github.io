### Introduction:
A weather app made for Android using Kotlin. To get the weather data the app uses Android's volley library to make an API request using the user's location and then the response is parsed using a JSON library. The data is all obtained from the OpenWeatherAPI. There is also a toggle for Farenheit and Celcius and a search box to look up the weather in a different location.
